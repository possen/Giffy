# Giffy

## This project demonstrates the following:

- Querying Giphy to search for items based upon a keyword.
- Utilizes the Swift 4 facility to decode the JSON directly into objects. 
- An autocomplete facility which changes and filters based upon what letters are typed (currently a hard coded list).   
- Allows selection of the word.
- Always displays the first item in the record (would be nice to add a way to select from many)
- Use of Adaptors to keep the reponsibilities of the objects limited and avoid the MassivViewController antipattern.
